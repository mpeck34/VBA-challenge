== Basic Instructions ==

Run sub procedure "forEachWs" to begin.
This macro is intended for use with the Worksheet titled "Multiple_year_stock_data" as supplied by EDX.


== Description ==

This macro will cycle through the sheets within the Worksheet and evaluate the stocks, returning some basic information.
The information for the active sheet will be displayed upon that sheet in a new column.

The stocks will be simply analysed for their increase or decrease in value over the time frame supplied in the Worksheet.

This will be displayed as the quantity of the increase or decrease from the initial value, and what percentage increase or decrease this represents from the initial value.
The total stock volume will also be displayed.


== Bonus ==

There is some extra information displayed as part of a 'bonus' section for this challenge.
The macro will select the best and worst performer - by percentage - and display this in a new column area, as well as the stock with the greatest total volume.



Requires Excel with macros enabled
